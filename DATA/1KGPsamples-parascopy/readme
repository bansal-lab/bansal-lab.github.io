Parascopy copy number results for 167 loci (coding LCRs) across 2504 1000 genomes project samples
===================================================================================================

The 2504 samples were divided into 5 groups (EUR, AFR, SAS, EAS, AMR) according to their continental population for analysis. The CN output is summarized in the files *.samples.bed.gz. The format of this file is described here: https://github.com/tprodanov/parascopy/blob/main/docs/cn_output.md#copy-number-profiles
