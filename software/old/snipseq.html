<font face="arial, sans-serif" size="2">SNIP-Seq&nbsp; is a program that utilizes short-read Illumina sequence data from a population of samples to detect SNPs and assign genotypes.&nbsp; Many methods for multi-sample SNP calling have been proposed that calculate genotype likelihoods by using the base quality values from all samples. However, these methods do not use information about sequencing error rates present in the data itself. The key idea underlying the SNIP-Seq method is use to use information from base-quality values and also sequence reads from multiple individuals to iteratively estimate the genotypes and sequencing error rates. <br>
<br>
The program, implemented in Python, has been evaluated on several population datasets generated by targeted sequencing of several hundred kilobases of the human genome in 50 to 300 samples.&nbsp;For more information about SNIP-Seq, please see the following publication:<br>
